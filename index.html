		<h3>How to Build a LEGO Set</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Start by going to a local store and purchasing a set that is of interest to you.</li>
					<li>Make sure to take your time building it is 80% of what makes the LEGO buyiong process enjoyable so if it is a bigger set then make sure to spread out you building time.</li>
					<li>Next once home clear off a space big enough so that way you can seperate the parts out evenly.</li>
					<li>You can either seperate/sort the pieces by size as I normally do, or any other way that works for your brain such as, color.</li>
					<li>Then either use the booklet given to you or if possoble use the more convienient digital instructions which if you have a computer or laptop is the option I would recomend.</li>
					<li>Now make sure to follow eac step very closly because if you miss a step it can be very hard to track down when you messed up.</li>
					<li>Lastly take your final product and make a nice space to display it so that people can experience the set is all its glory.</li>
					<li>As an extra step you can add extra "minifigures" so that your set looks more full and dynamic.</li>
